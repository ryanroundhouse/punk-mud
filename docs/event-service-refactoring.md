# Event Service Refactoring

## Overview

This document explains the approach taken to refactor the `eventService.js` file into smaller, more manageable, and more testable components. The initial implementation had several concerns mixed together, making the code difficult to test and maintain.

## Problem Statement

The original `eventService.js` file had the following issues:

1. **Too many responsibilities**: The file handled everything from event discovery, node navigation, quest integration, combat integration, and more.
2. **Poor testability**: The tightly coupled nature made unit testing nearly impossible without extensive mocking.
3. **Repeated logic**: The same code patterns (like ensuring node IDs or validating structure) were scattered throughout the file.
4. **Large file size**: The file was over 1,000 lines of code, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

## Refactoring Approach

We started by identifying logical components within the event service that could be extracted:

1. **Event Node Service**: Handles event tree traversal, node validation, and structure management.
2. **Event State Manager**: Manages the active event state for users.
3. **Event Choice Processor**: Processes user choices within events.
4. **Quest Event Integration**: Handles quest-related activities within events.
5. **Combat Event Integration**: Manages combat initiation and processing from events.
6. **Skill Check Service**: Handles skill check logic in events.

The initial phase of refactoring focused on extracting the `EventNodeService` component.

## EventNodeService

The `EventNodeService` is responsible for:

1. **Finding nodes** in the event tree structure
2. **Validating node structure** to ensure consistency
3. **Ensuring node IDs** exist for proper tracking
4. **Managing quest completion events** consistency across choices
5. **Loading nodes from the database** with proper validation

### Benefits of Extraction

1. **Improved Testability**: The `EventNodeService` can be tested independently with simple unit tests, without needing to mock the entire event system.
2. **Clearer Responsibility**: Each method has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Reusability**: The extracted functionality can be used by other services that need to work with event nodes.
4. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common node manipulation logic is now centralized.

## Implementation Details

### New File Structure

- `src/services/eventNodeService.js`: The new service for node management
- `tests/unit/services/eventNodeService.test.js`: Comprehensive unit tests

### Changes to eventService.js

1. **Dependency Injection**: The `eventService.js` now uses the `eventNodeService` for node operations
2. **Removed Helper Function**: The `findNodeInEventTree` helper function was moved to `eventNodeService`
3. **Simplified Code**: Node validation and manipulation logic is delegated to the specialized service

### Testing Approach

The new service is fully unit tested with the following test categories:

1. **Finding Nodes**: Tests for locating nodes in complex tree structures
2. **ID Generation**: Tests for ensuring nodes have proper IDs
3. **Validation**: Tests for ensuring nodes have consistent structure
4. **Quest Event Consistency**: Tests for maintaining consistent quest events
5. **Node Cloning**: Tests for proper deep copying of nodes
6. **Database Integration**: Tests for loading nodes from the database

## Future Work

This initial refactoring is the first step in a larger effort. Future phases will include:

1. Extracting `EventStateManager` from state service interactions
2. Creating a dedicated `EventChoiceProcessor` for choice handling
3. Separating `QuestEventIntegration` for quest-related operations
4. Extracting `CombatEventIntegration` for combat-related functionality
5. Creating a `SkillCheckService` for skill check operations

## Impact on Performance and Maintainability

1. **Performance**: The refactoring is expected to have a neutral impact on performance, as the same operations are being performed
2. **Maintainability**: Significantly improved, with clearer separation of concerns and better testability
3. **Onboarding**: New developers can understand smaller, focused components more easily
4. **Bug Fixing**: Isolated components enable more targeted debugging and fixes

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the event service demonstrates how a large, monolithic service can be broken down into smaller, more focused components. This approach improves code quality, maintainability, and testability while preserving the existing functionality.
