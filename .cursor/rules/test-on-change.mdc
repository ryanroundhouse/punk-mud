ENSURE ALL TESTS PASS AFTER IMPLEMENTING A CHANGE BEFORE YOU'RE DONE.
Always pick out the business logic that's being asked to be implemented.  When you find one ALWAYS CREATE A TEST FOR IT.  Ensure the test isn't brittle.  It shouldn't test implementation, it should focus on the logic.  Tests are in the /test folder.
